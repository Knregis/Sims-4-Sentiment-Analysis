AITA for being in love with my best friend?,"I‚Äôm a YA who has lived with my two best friends since the day this small town we live in was built. The neighbors know us as the BFF‚Äôs and we‚Äôve always been super close. Let‚Äôs just call me S.

My roommate Travis fell in love with this woman, Hannah, and moved out to be with her. After he left, he invited me to the wedding as their one witness. After seeing him standing at the end of the aisle, I realized I was in love with him and clearly he must love me too since I was the only guest at the wedding.

I confessed my feelings to him, even asked him to woohoo with me in a bush, and he rejected me and told me I was out of line. But I think it‚Äôs important he knows all of his options and that I‚Äôm here when he‚Äôs ready.

He then shut me out of his life completely! Without Travis, I was forced to lure Hannah‚Äôs ex Don Lothario to my house and give him a makeover to look like Travis. Don says that it‚Äôs really creepy and I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.

Now, Don is in my basement and I‚Äôve been learning magic and even set Hannah on fire once. It wasn‚Äôt successful but Travis still says I‚Äôm crazy and need to stay away from them.

Don says he doesn‚Äôt want to be in my basement anymore either as my own personal Travis doll. I told him that wasn‚Äôt an option.

I love Travis and want to be with him any way I can. AITA for wanting to be with my one true love, even if it‚Äôs Don dressed as him until I can convince Travis to be mine, and eventually get rid of Don once that happens?",0.99,6693,0,6693,1732815827.0

But activating wicked whims with my current body. My sex drive came back. I've seen my body dysmorphia is so in my head.
I finally understood what my husband says ""I wish you could look in the mirror and see what I see"". And I did.

The angles, the positions, it's not what I thought I was.

When I made myself my old weight, I was super turned off. Watching ""bonehilda"" bang isn't cute lmao. (And I don't mean that to skinny shame anyone. I don't want to give my low numbers to trigger anyone. But it was very far from healthy).

Magically Preserving My Son's Future Wife. This Game Is So Messed Up...,"So it just hit me what I've actually been doing, and I gotta admit its pretty messed up.

Been doing a legacy game and the current generation is an immortal Spellcaster husband and a Vampire wife.  Wife is a celebrity, and ended up having one of the random generated townie Paparazzi being really cute.  Least I assume she's a random townie, as her name doesn't have any results when I google it.

So we befriended the cute paparazzi girl, and the spellcaster has given her a Potion of Rejuvenation several times to keep her in Young Adult just so she could hang around for a while.  If it tells you anything about how long its been, Olivia Kim-Lewis is a full on Adult in the save at this point and the other random paparazzi died of old age already.  Along the way, he turned her into a spellcaster.

Well, my sims just had their kid, a boy, and I'm going ""Hey, this will be perfect.  Just one or two more rejuvs and the ages should line up so the kid can marry her!  She's already besties with the family, she appears to have good genetics, and she's already a spellcaster, this will be great!""

Then it kind of hit me.  I've been magically stopping this woman from aging for like 40 years already, and gonna be another 20 years before my kid is old enough to marry her.  She would have been in her 20's when she first generated.

My freshly minted 18 year old son is going to be marrying an 80 year old thats been kept in magic tupperware to preserve freshness.

Guys! I think I found a life hack for mental health via this game! ,"I was feeling really down about myself and just overall shitty, so I altered my SimSelf with what I believe to be my worst traits.

I‚Äôve started doing those wants irl for myself and I‚Äôm so much more content!

My experience: 

My traits were lazy, erratic, and loner. I take more naps now, relax more, talk to myself in the mirror in nice ways, and purposely avoid social interaction for at least 1 entire day per week. Oddly enough, relieving these traits of their ‚Äúwants‚Äù has allowed my other traits to be more helpful and motivational. I play my flute, paint, read, cook, meditate, and play with my cats more often.

I mainly built this for my legacy kids, who don't have personalities yet so the bedrooms are plain. Thats also why there's some random pack stuff, but the crucial ones are Cottage Living and Castle Estates.

I spent 7 years with someone who abused me emotionally and physically, in addition to entitling himself to my full personal income. He forced me to buy all DLC on his account (for all the games we played, not just the Sims)
After I finally got away from him, I lost access to any DLC I had purchased in the past. That was more than $550 USD for Sims 4 alone, not to mention thousands of dollars in other DLC and in-game purchases. After years of abuse, I think I had stopped fighting it for my own safety. It was the least of my worries at the time. 

But here I am, 7 months later, healthy and safe, finally getting my Sims life back. It sounds dumb, I suppose. But Sims has *always* been my escape, my creative outlet. I missed it so dearly. This community got me through the worst times of my life.

Left the sims 4 running fully autonomously for 3 days here's what happened.,"Had to use a few mods, the mods did the following. Auto pay bills, auto make popup choices, make them more self sufficient, make them have kids on their own, and make the sims repair objects on their own. 

The sims ALL had conflicting personalities and there were 6 of them (to leave room for children).

Hour one
I build a small 8 bed house, 4 bunks per room and large communal spaces and get them all jobs and let the game take over


Hour 3 
To my horror Art Woman, the materialistic gloomy artist, ends up on a relationship with Fix Woman, the Neat genius industrious. This means two of our 3 potential parents are fully off the table but that's OK because we still have Evil woman the evil mean spirited glutton. 

Things go well and evil woman seems to be taking a liking to WooHoo Man, the Self Absorbed Loyal Romantic.

10 hours
Tragedy strikes as Evil Woman gets stuck after work standing in the driveway. She eventually starves to death waiting to go to work. Woohoo man died 6 hours later of extreme sadness, he kept mourning her grave in the front yard. 

11 hours
It was at this point the worst possible thing happens, Neat Woman is trying to cook something and sets the house on fire. Seeing as how the kitchen was in the basement for budget reasons she burns to death before the firemen can extinguish the fire. Fixit woman is depressed but manages to survive and a moment of hope shines that somebody might have a child. 

Life reaches a kind of uneasy stasis as things are being fixed, cleaned and the sims are staying mostly happy and fed. 

Hour 27
Fixit woman has began to build a romantic relationship with Slob Man, a slobbish bro snob, however before they're able to produce any children Lazy Man, a lazy good art lover pees himself in front of the mini-fridge. As Neat Woman is dead nobody prioritizes the mess and Fixit Woman decided it was more important to repair the broken mini-fridge. She is electrocuted by Lazy Man's urine and dies on the spot. 

Here's where things get weird. Fixit woman was the weak link. 
Although children can't be had now, Lazy Man and Slob Man achieved apotheosis. For the next FOURTY FIVE HOURS they develop a GOD TIER strategy for survival. 

They both REFUSE to fix anything and the house instantly goes to shambles. Everything is broken and all plumbing is busted.

They wake up, upset, pee on the floor and go to work hungry, they then EAT AT WORK and come home. By this time they're both in the orange mood and severely upset. Slob Man comes home to a filthy house and thinks ""Home Swwet Home!"" And his mood goes back up to green. Lazy Man comes home, has a good cry in the driveway then walks inside and sits in the comfy chair and makes unbreaking eye contact with a painting for the rest of the night. This gives him a buff from the chair, from Lazy, and from art lover. 


They then repeat this cycle, occasionally having work friends over (who visibly get sad when they enter the house) or talking to each other until they reach the Elder state and die of old age nearly starving to death but somewhat happy.

"If you love the Sims, if you love your Saves, take good care of them.","As a retired IT support person, I don't take it for granted that people know even the most basic facts about how to work computers, much less keep their Sims game working properly. It pains me when week after week I see posts from simmers who have lost long-time legacy saves or elaborate builds because of failures that could have been prevented.

So here is a list of the most basic tips that will help protect the game you love.

**Computer basics:**

* Never just switch off power on your computer when still running, even if all your programs are closed. Use the Shutdown command instead, because it triggers clean-up processes that keep your computer in good health.
* If you use your computer often, letting it go into sleep mode is better than frequent Shutdowns.
* Close all your software programs and Restart your computer at least once a week. This ensures that memory and other processes are cleared out and optimized. (Be sure you use the actual **Restart** command for this.)
* At the very least, once or twice a year run a cleaner program that removes malware and other intrusive programs that slow down your computer.
* Also, please hire someone to¬†*rid your PC or laptop of dust* at least once a year, at least twice a year if you have pets. You can also do this yourself with compressed air! Just please be careful and don't touch any computery bits to be on the safe side. If something needs a wipe-down, isopropyl alcohol is your best friend. The higher proof, the better. Do not use water to clean opened electronics!
* Make sure you have at least 15-20GB of free space on your boot drive. You need that much for the Sims (and other programs) to run smoothly. If you're running out of space, you can buy a 1TB external SSD for under $100 and move your Sims program files over to that drive, then point your EA settings to that new location.
* For Windows users: OneDrive can wreak havoc on Sims files. I ended up disabling it entirely. At the very least, make sure you exclude the Documents &gt; EA folder from your OneDrive sync (click on the small sync icon to the immediate left of the folder name). Back up manually instead.

**The Sims 4 basics:**

* Save often. I save every sims night when everyone (more or less) is in bed. I also save before possible death events, like grilling on the back porch, or after great achievements that I don't want to lose. (ETA: another simmer suggested saving in the morning when at least one sim wakes up, rather than when they're all asleep since this can create timing issues)
* Exit the game (close it down) at sane intervals. For me, that's every night when I'm done playing. Throughout the day I may exit to the Main Menu, but at the end of my RL day, I exit the game.
* If you're not closing the game because loading takes too long, then you need to fix that problem, not just try to work around it. Maybe you need more memory (it's cheap right now), or more storage (it's cheap right now). But keeping the game running will allow memory leaks and other issues to accumulate to the point where they could render your game inoperative. At the very least, close down once a week, then restart your computer (see above).
* BACK UP YOUR SAVES! All you need is a thumb drive. Copy over your Saves folder and date it. (Saves\_12-23-2024) I back up every few days and keep at least a month's worth of saves on my backup drive. ETA: If you want to preserve your Library contents, backup the Tray folder, too.

Okay, I feel better now. Happy holidays, Simmers!

Infants are the best babies in the history of this franchise even without the EP,"Yeah, infants are a bit boring without milestones, but I remember players asking for free babies for ages. That's what they are. They are babies and they are as free as possible. 

They can play with toys. They can pet cats and dogs. They can try new foods. Could babies in Sims 2 and Sims 3 do any of that? Nope. They were boring as hell, and all additional content (except for the changing table in Sims 2) was also paywalled. 

I think EA made a mistake by not patching infants earlier and not giving players time to play with them without having all that great expectations and/or confusion about what's in the pack and what's in the update. 

Infants are fine. They may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they are not unplayable without the EP. Just a bit bland, like babies always were.",0.95,2672,0,2672,1678893850.0

I wish new Sims didn‚Äôt have to actually be brand new to life.,"I know I‚Äôm far from the first person to point this out, but I hate how new Sims have no ability to have a backstory that is reflected in gameplay. I would love to be able to program Sims in CAS to reflect a past. Like when I make Elder Sims, I want them to retired from a successful career; and instead, I get unemployed sims whose greatest achievement is being an average high school student. I‚Äôd also love to be able to record a divorce without actually having to get divorced in the game. Especially the older the Sim is, the more it makes sense that they would have had more past relationships and experiences. I do like that you can create dead Sims now, because I use this feature a lot to create widows and widowers in CAS. 

Since younger Sims are allowed to develop skills in gameplay, it feels like you should get a certain number of skill points to assign to adult sims in CAS. (I‚Äôm pretty sure you were able to do this in Sims2.) Am I really supposed to believe that my young adult Sim whose greatest aspiration in life is to become a chef has never cooked before? She waited until she was 18 years old to make a grilled cheese sandwich? I realize you can easily cheat to increase skill points, but it‚Äôs somewhat tedious and I find that it sometimes randomly just doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs annoying that my super fit, workout obsessed Sim who owns a gym franchise has to get mentoring from a teenage Sim to gain skill faster, because for whatever reason, the cheat code just doesn‚Äôt work in his game. A gym mogul who‚Äôs a level 3 in fitness? Embarrassing lol. 

One thing I always laugh at is when two married sims who have multiple children together woo hoo in my game for the first time and it gets recorded as their first time ever woohooing.

It would also be fun to encounter NPCs who are randomly assigned back stories, even if they had to keep it a little more simplified. A cheerful vampire Sim who wants to find a soulmate? Kind of boring. A cheerful vampire Sim who was an overachiever in high school and has been divorced three times is looking for a soulmate? Far more intriguing.

Autonomy Is Worse than it's Ever Been and I Hate It,"Look. I love this game. This is VERY rare for me to complain about it because I'm a ""glass half full"" type of Simmer, but this... this is really, really really really infuriating.

I love infants. I really, genuinely do. I love everything about the concepts, the gameplay, the milestones. I love playing with them. I create new saves with single parents just so I can re-experience them again.

But the autonomy of adult sims is MADDENING, and not just with infants, but now with toddlers too.

I'm VERY good at micro-managing. I never ever play with autonomy off (and even if I wanted to it doesn't actually disable any autonomy to do with infants, I have tested this) and I do REALLY good with keeping up needs and controlling all sims to a T and making the most of each day. I'm REALLY good at it.I leave autonomy on so I can sometimes just focus on one sim, or the children, and the adults can do whatever they want without standing still and slowly dying.

The changes to Autonomy absolutely are ruining everything.

I'll queue up the following steps:

1. Change infant diaper
2. Put infant in high chair
3. Give infant carrots

My sim will:

1. Pick up infant
2. Put infant on floor
3. Pick infant back up
4. Check infant, erase all other queued items to do so
5. Go downstairs (still hasn't changed diaper)
6. Ignore my desperate pleas to PLEASE STOP
7. Put Infant on floor
8. Play peak-a-boo

The infant is starving, filthy, has a dirty diaper, and I'm actually, in the real world, screaming so loud I'm shocked I haven't woken up my real life toddler. It is INFURIATING. It happens with toddlers too. I'll put food up where the toddlers can reach it and queue them up to grab a plate each, maybe have one do the little potty first while the other grabs a plate.

HERE COMES MOM TO RUIN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING BY CANCELING UP ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I'VE QUEUED FOR HER AND THE TODDLERS BECAUSE SHE AUTONOMOUSLY \*MUST\* CHECK TODDLER.

I hate this. I hate it SO much. I have disabled autonomy for selected sims, and that absolutely has not stopped them from canceling everything I've queued up to ""check infant/toddler"". It's driving me mad. The team REALLY ruined it with this stupid autonomy tweak. Go back, please, for the love of God, GO BACK. I cannot play with autonomy permanently off, I just can't. I like letting sims do whatever for a little while.

Edit: I logged back on a day later and i have over 150 notifications, what have I done lmfao XD",0.99,2460,0,2460,1684033788.0
Why do they keep pushing to make gnomes happen???,"No simmer EVER asked for more gnomes. I mean who doesn‚Äôt remove the gnomes from Harvestfest? Who put gnome decorations in their house? If the sims wanted to add a duality or something to the fairies they could have made ¬´¬†fairies and pirates¬†¬ª or something but WHY THE GNOMES?????

I‚Äôve waited for fairies for years. I‚Äôve tried the new pack on a friend‚Äôs computer and I think I‚Äôm not going to buy this pack for myself because of the number 1 reason being the gnomes, even though I feel like I‚Äôm overall being gaslighted into thinking this is a good pack by the sim YouTubers.

I turned off the balance thing in settings and even though I get less ailments, there needs to be ONE person on the lot who‚Äôs sick and oh gnomes appear all around me.

Unpopular Opinion| Restrict Sims to Their Respective Worlds &amp; Districts!,Y'know what really grinds my gears? When my sim is living in Mt. Komorebi (Which is obviously based on Japan) and seeing Bob Pancakes outta nowhere wandering the streets when that fat bastard lives in Willow Creek! (Which Is modeled after the southern flora of the U.S‚Ä¶..New Orleans presumably) see what I mean? It totally breaks immersion and as well as storytelling when you see these random Sims from other worlds intruding like nobodies business especially when the worlds are modeled after different places AND countries which would imply extensive travel or financial requirements to even get there. It just utterly breaks any kind of realism especially if you're playing multiple households and maybe you don't want specific sims to meet or cross paths that you made but want them to still live another life or scenario or in another world. Like you should ONLY see them wandering the streets of the world they ACTUALLY reside in or another district of the same world. So far I haven't seen anyone complain about it or even create a solution for this annoying system. Which I feel like it's a very easy fix like if the damn game wants NPCs to populate streets then just have it to where NPCs without households wander the streets NOT already established residents living in another world.,0.92,2360,0,2360,1683184874.0

Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice them there and then I start having them clean up and there‚Äôs about 8 cups of expired drinks.

Popcorn machine - I swear as soon as they are hungry, they ALWAYS start popping some popcorn. I try to make them dinner and the kids or the spouse is coming to the counter for the popcorn! 

Coffee - in the same framework as above, the coffee machine irks me. It would be the middle of their night and they are obviously tired so I click on their sleep icon and you would think they would go to sleep, right? WRONG! THEYRE GOING TO GET COFFEE! WHY!!!

That giant microscope - I don‚Äôt even have any science career sims this time and they keep going to that thing when in a Focused mood. Like, give that thing a break! 

The pool - it‚Äôs fine in the summer but in the winter? When it‚Äôs snowing in game? Nothing raises my blood pressure more than seeing their icon turn blue and I look out to see them SWIMMING IN THE WINTER! And then I try to rush them in, they lag and die.

The Bjergsen‚Äôs have the BEST storyline in my save.,"Out of all my households, the Bjergsens are easily the most interesting and fun to play in my save. I gave them everything: family tension, secret lives, messy emotions, and storylines that somehow built themselves while I was just trying to play normally. Genuinely the most fun storyline I did. 

Starting off with Clara, the mother. she‚Äôs a perfectionist to her core. She runs her household like it‚Äôs a project. every meal, every routine, every decision has to fit her vision of ‚Äúthe perfect family.‚Äù Her aspiration is successful lineage, which basically defines how she parents: she wants her kids to be perfect, ambitious, and successful in every measurable way. and because of that, she‚Äôs obsessed with the idea of raising a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù daughter. Naturally, she directs all of that energy toward Sofia, her oldest.

But Sofia was never meant to fit into Clara‚Äôs mold. In my save, I made her more of a repressed rebel. not the party-hard type, she just doesn‚Äôt care about the traditional path her mom wants for her. Clara keeps pushing her toward something stable, something ‚Äúrespectable,‚Äù but Sofia only cares about music. She loves songwriting, guitar, and singing. It‚Äôs what makes her feel alive. and school just doesn‚Äôt matter to her. She usually skips class and is a D student most of the time.

Eventually, Sofia starts dating Wolfgang, who‚Äôs part of the Renegades, which makes everything worse because Sofia herself is in the Paragons, their rival club. He‚Äôs rough around the edges, nothing like the kind of person Clara would ever approve of, and maybe that‚Äôs exactly why Sofia is drawn to him. Their friendship (and maybe more than that) gives her space to exist without being ‚Äúthe perfect daughter‚Äù.

The Paragons are all about looks, status, and image, the perfect club that Clara expects Sofia to be in, and Sofia can‚Äôt stand that. She falls out with their leader, and at that point, she‚Äôs pretty much done trying to fit in anywhere. Between the Paragons‚Äô impossible perfection and her mom‚Äôs constant pressure, she just wants to be free. She just wants to live as her own person. But her teenage years have already passed her by.

Meanwhile, Clara‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúfixing‚Äù Sofia means her younger daughter, Elsa, often gets ignored &amp; overlooked. Elsa‚Äôs a genius, genuinely gifted in the noggin, but she doesn‚Äôt get much attention because her mom‚Äôs too focused on Sofia‚Äôs ‚Äúfailures.‚Äù But the irony is, Elsa ends up becoming everything Clara ever wanted.
Without anyone‚Äôs eyes on her, Elsa teaches herself, explores her curiosity, and grows into this brilliant mind. Clara doesn‚Äôt realize any of this yet, though, not until it‚Äôs too late. So Elsa ends up bonding more with her dad, Bjorn, and with another kid genius I made, Sophie Sue.

Sophie is one of my favorite Sims I‚Äôve ever made ‚Äî eccentric, erratic, 180 IQ, and endlessly curious. Elsa and Sophie Sue quickly become childhood best friends ‚Äî basically partners in crime. They instantly bond over their shared love for science and the weird, unexplained things in the world. And they also fill each other‚Äôs loneliness. From Elsa‚Äôs overlooked achievements, to Sophie‚Äôs orphaned, non sheltered life, they grow up side by side.

They form a club together where they do everything, build rockets, use microscopes and telescopes, program, play chess, you name it. What‚Äôs cute is that they‚Äôre not even competitive. They just love learning together, and that mutual curiosity keeps pushing them both forward, into a much brighter future. the perfect mix of calm intellect, reckless adventure, and the quiet comfort they find in each other.

Elsa becomes more of a robotics and programming genius, while Sophie Sue is the collector and environmental innovator ‚Äî she‚Äôs all about fossils, crystals, and nature. They balance each other out so well, and their bond just never fades. They move together, to Strangerville, work tirelessly together to uncover it‚Äôs mysteries, fight by and for each other and basically become the saviors of Strangerville.
The teenage prodigy duo.
Two heroes.

Back at home, Over time, Clara starts to realize something she can‚Äôt quite admit out loud: she spent years trying to mold Sofia into her idea of a perfect daughter, only to ignore the one who quietly became exactly that. Seeing her daughter‚Äôs face on the news ‚Äî the one she barely paid attention to ‚Äî smart, disciplined, accomplished..
She realizes, painfully, that the ‚Äúperfect daughter‚Äù she spent years trying to mold already existed right under her nose. However, Elsa became that all on her own, not because of Clara‚Äôs control, but in spite of it.

Elsa Bjergsen isn‚Äôt the quiet little sister anymore, she‚Äôs a famous, respected mastermind!

Clara feels the heavy weight of guilt, for pushing Sofia too hard and stifling her dreams, forcing her to start her dream life later than she should have. And for neglecting Elsa so deeply that she barely recognizes her own daughter anymore. She finally understands that her obsession with perfection didn‚Äôt just drive her family forward, it drove both her daughters away, in different ways.

Sofia‚Äôs relationship with Elsa is complicated too. a mix of gratitude and jealousy. She‚Äôs thankful that their mother‚Äôs attention finally shifted away from her, giving her room to breathe, but she can‚Äôt help envying her sister‚Äôs success. Elsa became this celebrated genius, the savior of Strangerville, while Sofia, who had her dreams pushed aside for so long, is still chasing her goal of becoming a famous musician. Elsa achieved everything Sofia once wanted: recognition, brilliance, freedom. It‚Äôs a bittersweet feeling, she‚Äôs proud of her sister, yet she can‚Äôt shake the ache of watching Elsa live the dream she spent her whole childhood trying to chase.

And on the flip side, Elsa carries her own quiet resentment toward Sofia as well, a small, unspoken belief that if Sofia had just gone along with their mother a little more, maybe Clara wouldn‚Äôt have ignored her so completely. It isn‚Äôt hate, not even anger, just that lingering what if that sits silently between them.

Then, on the other side of all this family drama, there‚Äôs Bjorn Bjergsen ‚Äî Clara‚Äôs husband and the quiet backbone of the household. He‚Äôs calm, steady, and seems like the least dramatic person in the family, but his story is easily the darkest.

Bjorn is a secret agent, high up in the Diamond Agent branch, level nine. He‚Äôs loyal, composed, and takes his work seriously, rarely talking about it at home. Naturally, Elsa gravitates toward him. She‚Äôs close to her father in a way her mother never was, she admires his calm logic, his quiet strength, and in some ways, she inherits it.

But Bjorn‚Äôs career has its shadows. Working for the S.I.M. Agency, he‚Äôs dealt with cases most people never hear about, fugitives, traitors, double agents. One of those names was Kayla Rossi, a former agent turned wanted criminal for treason. She defected years ago, leaking classified intel and vanishing from the system.

Here‚Äôs where the story gets dark, and where the game, completely by coincidence, handed me one of my favorite twists ever. 

Kayla Rossi, vanished years ago under mysterious circumstances. Everyone assumes she‚Äôs dead, and she is. What no one realizes, though, is that Bjorn was the one who unknowingly commissioned her assassination. It wasn‚Äôt personal, it was protocol. One he couldn‚Äôt disobey. She was wanted for treason, and eliminating her was part of his job. He never knew who she really was, never knew she was Sophie Sue‚Äôs mother until it was too late.

Sophie Sue‚Äôs Mother‚Ä¶
His daughter‚Äôs best friend ‚Äî the girl he welcomes into his home, the one who helped Elsa find herself ‚Äî lost her mother because of him.

They live together, work together, and are basically never apart. And meanwhile, the father of one unknowingly destroyed the mother of the other. Neither of them knows it, and now Bjorn has to live with the quiet tragedy sitting at the center of his own family.

That‚Äôs what makes the Bjergsens so special to me. Every single member carries their own story, It‚Äôs all connected. the mother who pushed too hard, the daughter who ran, the sister who rose, and the father whose duty turned into tragedy.

Just a little rant,"I hate that, ever since my child got the Mean Streak phase and was mean to her brother, that she's now randomly mean to him, even though she doesn't have the phase anymore, doesn't have any negative traits, and has a fantastic relationship with her brother.

Once her other brother got the phase, I noped out to a getaway for a few days. I wasn't gonna deal with another child being mean. I already have this issue with another Sim of mine in a different household. She keeps being mean to her family, even though she doesn't have mean traits, but she had gotten the Mean Streak phase as a child.

Is there like...no way I can get them to stop? Or is it like workout machines where if you get them started, they'll obsessively do it until the end of time? üòÖ

You ever not even play a family seriously and then end up loving them?,"One of my vampire ladies found a rando townie vampire as a date on Cupid‚Äôs Corner. He was meh looking, but not the worst as far as townies go, and what were the odds of finding a vampire in the wild when my save is inundated with werewolf townies due to past mistakes? She got pregnant, so I had them become official and moved them in together to see where things would go. After the first kid, they got pregnant at almost the same time, which I was really not happy about because I do not have much patience for multiple infants at the same time, but then the pseudo twins aged up, and I fell in love with them after already giving them stupid names when they were babies because I was mad at them, lol. 

The black-haired son is a vampire/werewolf hybrid‚ÄîI found out later that paternal grandpa is a hybrid werewolf/vampire/alien, which is what caused this weird case of vampires with a hybrid vampire/werewolf baby‚Äîside note: that guy is sooo glitched looking from being a hybrid, lol. But anyway, he was named Fern because his dad has the plant-lover trait, and the mom has the outdoorsy and mystical traits, so it felt stupid but right, and then the alien is named Moon because it was the first, half-arsed, space-related name I thought of at the time, and it also felt right for the hippy dippy mom. Their first kid was named Cosmo because mystical Sims have that ‚Äúconsult the cosmos‚Äù self interaction which I only noticed right before he was born. (I am awful at naming Sims.)

It was just funny timing, but the dad went into labor first with Moon at the same time a werewolf had made everyone faint from terror, so it seemed like he was scared into going into labor. But the boys were born just a few in-game hours apart and are BFF brothers from other mothers, literally, lol. With a hybrid occult mod and and a mod that makes turning Sims into vampires an action that can be done autonomously, Fern turned Moon into a vampire too, which I thought was fitting since they‚Äôre so close. They even got abducted at the exact same time once. 

The dad keeps getting abducted and had three more alien babies and got actual twins the last time, which topped off the household at 8, so then I had to take a break from that family to play the alien daughter separately and do Villainous Valentine, lol. Too many babies at the same time and in rapid succession gives me burnout so fast. ",0.99,66,0,66,1760235968.0

***Photo 2:*** Eliza comes home from work to find that Bob has already left. He still had another two hours before he had to leave for work... funny how today he's decided that he *needs* to be early.

***Photo 3:*** Hurt and annoyed, Eliza heads out to ladies' night at the local bar. Bob made her wait, so he can wait for her in return.

***Photos 4&amp;5:*** He left home early and comes home late. Bob didn't *plan* on running from their talk, but he couldn't help but fear the worst. He was *so sure* this talk was her telling him she was leaving, telling *him* to leave, that she's had enough. He can't bear the thought of life without her.

***Photos 6&amp;7:*** Eliza wakes Bob the next morning and tells him to prepare himself. She waits for him, surprisingly patiently, as he drags his feet, makes himself breakfast, brushes his teeth. She waits, and eventually... he comes to her. She doesn't want to *leave* him, but she can't keep living like this, either. They *need* this.

He's taking his meds regularly, he's got a solo therapist to help with his depression, and Eliza is... stuck. She feels like she's slipping. She doesn't know how to stop...

Then Alice gives her the news... she's expecting baby number two, and she wanted to tell Eliza in person, now, without anyone else around them, so that she doesn't feel like she has to hide how she really feels. Alice is her best friend, after all, but Eliza is happy for her. Really, she is.

***Photos 14&amp;15:*** But that doesn't stop her. She heads out to Oasis Springs, finds a bar out there. It's the afternoon, after all, too early for her to be drinking, and she can't risk it getting back to her friends, to Bob. But the bartender's nice. He listens to her, talks to her. She finds herself forgetting about everything in their conversations. He cuts her off, but it's too late. Eliza heads off into the night before he can offer to call her a cab home.

***Photos 16-19:*** Bob returned home from work with no sign of Eliza and a missed call from Alice. He calls, and she tells him what happened. About the baby, and Alice apologises that he has to find out over the phone, she wanted to tell them both together, but Eliza didn't look *right* when she left, and *is she home*? She wasn't. So Bob fell asleep on the sofa, and when Eliza came home, he told her to come sit with him. The thing is... Bob knew that the cleaning and the *anger* was Eliza's way of coping with their loss. He knew she couldn't let herself be sad. But he was struggling, too, and he didn't notice the drinking until it got to this point. Until she started staying out all night. He's worried about her.

My sim has the worst luck,"So my sim Anastasia, was in an arranged marriage to her husband Malakai. I‚Äôve made it a whole story like that theyre both from rich families, his family all died tragically in an accident when he was young and so he was raised by his grandmother out of the spotlight. 

Once Malakai became of age his grandmother told him that he needed to get out into society and get married, keep the bloodline going. His grandmother passed away from old age and shortly after her passing he decided that he‚Äôd marry Anastasia, after her parents put her into society. She was furious, she always wanted to marry someone out of love and not for money or power. So, she was mad at her parents and also mad at Malakai. They hated one another for a long time. 

Then Anastasia was frustrated because she couldn‚Äôt figure out how to cook anything, everything was bad quality and she just wanted to make something edible. That‚Äôs when Malakai stepped in and taught her how to cook his favourite meals. He was taught by his grandma and would cook everyday with her. He also taught her how to grow and harvest their own fruits and vegetables to be used. 

She taught him how to play the piano after she used to sit there for hours on end as a child being taught proper etiquette and skills for a lady. They soon fell in love. Seeing the hardships that one another faced growing up and loving each other for how they‚Äôd grown and become the person they are today. They had a daughter, Aurora. They loved her to pieces, Malakai being a very good father, doing tummy time with her and teaching her to crawl. Also helping her with her skills as a toddler and reading to her. 

Anastasia fell pregnant again, this time it was going to be a boy. The two of them couldn‚Äôt figure out a good name for their son, always putting names out there but none of them fitting. 

One night, with everyone asleep Malakai decided to go and look at the stars. Trying to get any inspiration for their son‚Äôs name. He thought this would be a good idea since their daughter was named after the lights in the sky, so why not have a look at them? Malakai was suddenly struck by a meteorite and tragically died that night. In the same night, Anastasia went into labour and delivered their baby boy. Malakai Jr.  

Anastasia was depressed after the tragic loss of her husband. She moved back in with her parents, where she raised her two children. 
After a few years she met a man that she fell in love with. She fell pregnant with his child. She proposed to him, hoping to complete her family. He said no. He ran away. Leaving her pregnant and alone. She panicked, and went to Marc a man who had been her friend for a few years now. 

Marc had a massive crush on her and tried to pursue her a few times now. Each time she said no, now, she ran to him. Telling him that she‚Äôs been interested all along, she just wasn‚Äôt ready to be with someone else after her husband. Marc was ecstatic. They soon got married, she gave birth to her daughter Amelia. Soon after that she fell pregnant again and gave birth to their daughter Abigail. 

They‚Äôd been struggling financially with four children to look after, having to sell items in the house just to be able to pay rent. Marc has been constantly burned out and now going through a midlife crisis. He must have been really struggling after finding out that one of his daughters isn‚Äôt actually his, because he just couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Laughing at himself for trusting Anastasia and raising that baby as his own. He laughed so much that he died. 

Now Anastasia is left all alone with four children, she could move back in with one of her parents. They divorced and her mum is raising her little sister, the baby she had to try to salvage her marriage. And her dad is married to an alien and has four alien babies with her. 
What am I supposed to do!?

The best idea I‚Äôve ever had: The Lightning Riders,"Required DLC: Get together (for the club stuff)

Highly recommended DLC: City Living (for the Gremlins home trait) 

Club particulars‚Ä¶

Join requirements: not child, not ghost. 

Required activities: repair objects 

Banned activities: clean, be friendly 

Lot type: residential or tiny home

Lot traits: cursed, gremlins

Make counters, put dishwashers in them, put coffee makers on top. Have someone live in the area and go to sleep before midnight to activate the gremlins and break everything. Then start a club gathering. The dishwashers make puddles which will increase the risk of ‚Äúriding the lightning‚Äù significantly. Once all the things are fixed or all the sims have ridden the lightning, call off the group and sleep again to reactivate the Gremlins and break everything again. Then invite more people to the group. 

The graves will be in the household inventory so you can collect them for your own use.

If you don‚Äôt have city living you can use the sabotage trait to manually destroy each item, or you can just use mods, I‚Äôm sure one exists for that",0.92,18,0,18,1757440939.0

Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if we could build outside our lot boundaries in The Sims 4? üè°‚ú®,"Hi everyone!

One thing I‚Äôve always wished for in The Sims 4 is the ability to build beyond the lot boundaries. Right now, our creativity is locked inside the lot, but imagine being able to expand into the surrounding streets, parks, and world areas to make neighborhoods feel truly alive.

This could:

Give builders so much more freedom.

Let us place houses, parks, or even small details outside the lot.

Make worlds feel more personal and customizable, keeping the game fresh.

I shared this idea on the official EA forum, and it would mean a lot if fellow players who like this vision could support it there. The more attention it gets, the better the chances EA/Maxis will notice!

A Sims 4 modder is charging early access for bug fixes. Is this where modding is headed?,"This might be one of the biggest shifts in Sims 4 modding I‚Äôve seen.

A popular creator ([JellyPaws](https://www.patreon.com/posts/137170630)) just announced they‚Äôre putting **critical fixes/compatibility updates** for their mods behind *Patreon early access*. The actual bug fixes that keep existing mods usable when a patch breaks them.

Yes, EA allows temporary paywalls (as long as it‚Äôs free later). But this feels different. Until that window passes, non-patrons can‚Äôt even use the mod they already had.

* If the creator doesn‚Äôt have time to update ‚Üí totally fair, life happens.
* If the fix *is done* but locked for paying users ‚Üí that‚Äôs a choice.

And that choice could set a precedent. If more modders follow, Sims modding could shift from passion-driven community work into something closer to paid maintenance.

Unpopular opinion: Sims without mods/cc is fun,"And I am also a PC player fyi. I know I will get downvoted for scorched earth but oh well. I have been playing the sims without mods since the dawn of time on PC. Call me vanilla all you want üòÇ but it‚Äôs actually not that bad. Please know that I am not against mods/cc at all and to each their own. I think there is a lot of amazing mods/ccs out there that enhance the gameplay a lot more and I actually used two of them (one about height difference and the MC command mod). I quickly started disliking the height mod cos it glitched a lot and when the sims would cook or kiss, they would just go into each other and other objects and it didn‚Äôt feel natural. MC commands was actually fun and made the whole cheat system a lot easier, but it was a lot a little glitchy and I felt like it didn‚Äôt add too much to the gameplay. 

Maybe I haven‚Äôt found good mods yet but I have been wondering about mental health, menstrual cycles, illnesses (cancer, etc), murder and drug use and alcohol intoxication (and maybe sex). If anyone knows a mod or two that does that, please feel free to share but I don‚Äôt want to download more than 2 mods. 

I am just looking to make the game more realistic but not really change any of its features (like ccs for example).

Free Love is Too Free...,"Once upon a time, there was a young adult named Airi Endo. She had a dream. A dream so big, it'd span generations: have 100 children. She knew it would be hard. No same sim wants to deal with multiple children in the worst stages of young life. But she was determined. However, no matter how seductive she made herself, these men were just too damn loyal. And then came Knox Greenwood. He told her all about eco living and about Neighborhood Action Plans. Knox offered a list of all the different plans a neighborhood could enact to make the world a better place. And within that list, she found her salvation. A NAP known as Free Love.

Free Love would let her be with anyone so long as she brought them home. And it wouldn't be considered cheating! It was almost too good to be true. So she asked Knox, who had just offered his services to her dream, how one would enact these NAPs. He said voting before Monday would be the best way and asking others to get on her side to sway the vote.

So Airi picked up a clipboard and regaled everyone she knew with the benefits of Free Love. Some Sims were against it, saying they could never be with someone other than their spouse. Others were totally onboard, eager to experience something (or someone) new. And with a little hard work and much persuasion, Free Love was enacted.

Her dream became easier than ever. One child turned to two. Two turned to three. And three turned to five! Soon she had all possible young life stages in her household and everything felt right in the world. But then she caught something in the halls of her humble home. Something that sent a chill down her spine.

Her two teens were flirting with each other. She reprimanded them both. But nothing could stop it once it started. And before she knew it, the benefits she once saw as favorable turned sour and crumbled before her. That's when Airi learned that Free Love is too free...

TLDR: my two teen half siblings started flirting with each other. Is this normal under Free Love?",0.98,315,0,315,1754141986.0

"Testing the rumored ""get leftovers"" bug","I've been seeing this topic come up once every few weeks or so. For the past few months, whenever the topic of Sims' body weight comes up, everyone in the comments starts discussing how selecting ""get leftovers"" supposedly tags the leftovers as junk food, causing the Sims to gain weight rapidly. The supposed solution to this is to open the refrigerator and select the leftovers manually. The first day I saw this theory show up was a Reddit post a few months ago from someone reporting they saw it on TikTok, but the comments in the post seemed to debunk the theory. It doesn't actually make any sense with how the calorie system works in the game, since ""junk food"" itself doesn't make Sims gain weight, at least not any faster than regular food does. Each specific dish is allotted a specific number of calories. The Reddit post was later taken down by the poster after the comments disagreed with the theory and explained how the calorie system works in the game.

Anyway, after seeing yet another post with the comments spreading this theory without any actual sources, I decided to test it myself. I wasn't actually planning to post it anywhere; it was more for my own sanity to make sure I wasn't going crazy lol. But since I took the time to test it, I figured I might as well post the results here. Like I said, it wasn't a super rigorous experiment, per say. But I had my two Sims spend a week eating nothing but garden salads and using only the ""get leftovers"" options, no opening the refrigerator. They weren't allowed to exercise or do anything but eat, sleep, read, clean, chat, and go to school/work. It was pretty boring. They did this for an entire week. At the end of the week, not only did they not gain any noticeable weight, but they both gained the health food nut lifestyles. During this week they didn't get any negative moodlets about eating quick meals or anything like that. I'll post before and after pictures in the comments below.

Disclaimer: I know that sometimes bugs happen, and not everyone has the same bugs. But people are claiming that the game is designed to consider ""leftovers"" as ""junk food,"" which clearly isn't the case. Furthermore, the ""tagging as junk food"" theory doesn't make sense to begin with since each meal has a set number of calories, with even some gourmet dishes being more fattening than certain junk food dishes. If there is a bug happening in regard to weight, it's not on the EA bug forums yet that I can find even though this theory has been around for months, and it certainly doesn't have anything to do with leftovers being tagged as junk food. Basically my point in making this post is to let you guys know that you don't have to be afraid of leftovers. If your Sims are gaining weight quickly, it's probably because of what you're feeding them.",0.99,749,0,749,1753324594.0
I think I've narrowed down the crashing bug people keep on getting!,"So, after reinstalling my game, going through all 16k mod and cc files, and going insane, I believe I've narrowed down the reason for the crashing bug that so many people seem to be having.

**I believe that the crashing bug occurs when Sims make a family sized meal of anything (it might** ***only*** **be when the Sims use the stove).**

**Evidence:** I placed a sim on a lot by themselves, with all my mod and cc files removed, with just a fridge, counter, and stove and had them make a family sized meal (it seems to be okay with single servings). The moment the sim was half way through baking the meal the game crashed immediately.

I was able to back up my game files, reinstalled them and tried it again. The sim cooked the meal fully through this time, however, when I returned to the lot with the family meal plates on the counter the game would outright crash upon entering the lot.

I played the game for 3 hours today, breaking every stove in every lot they went into and didn't encounter a single crash.",0.9,54,0,54,1753341782.0
"Base Game, Cats and Dogs ONLY Build!!","I wanted to make a house that was easily available for more simmers as I know not everyone has, wants, or can afford to have multiple packs or all of the packs. I don't normally like limiting what packs I use, but after doing this I think I kind of like limited pack builds and will do them more often.

While deciding where to build it, I decided that I wanted to give myself another challenge: I can't move or delete any of the default landscaping. I built on the Sporting Space lot in Brindleton Bay, right next to the vet office. I think there are two or three trees that come default, so I built the house around those trees and added some of my own landscaping. Side note: I hate landscaping, I haven't completely figured out how to make it look up to my personal standards yet.

This lot would be nice for a family of 3-4 sims, a cat, and a dog.

I thought I had called it the ""Cozy Colonial House""... but somehow I called it the ""Crazy Colonial House."" I'm not sure how because I've fully have been referring to it as the Cozy Colonial and just within the last couple of days did I realize my mistake.

What I'd do to declutter the pie menu... What do you think?,"I know people hate the notification wall.   
But imagine if instead of countless interactions such as 'ask if mermaid', imagine if it was just ""discuss occults', and if the sim was a mermaid there'd be an animation/notification to say ""well.... i am a mermaid"" or ""well, I don't really believe in Vampires, do you?."" (And it would be good if the game could take into consideration that sim's friends etc.) 

Or instead of ALLLLL the movie hangout interactions the interaction was just ""discuss movie with group"" and then you'd get a notification to say ""Sim 1 doesn't really like comedy, but Sim 2 loved it! And she fancied the pants off the main character""

And if ""Discuss interests"" could be where a lot of the pointless friendly and trait specific interactions could be converted to notification answers, or maybe even buffs. 

On this note, I truly don't understand people who get mods that basically just add more interactions that lead to nowhere. Like, if it copies an animation, which it will, it doesn't add gameplay for me. I'd rather just click ""argue"" / ""Discuss interests"" or whatever interaction gives the animation I want, and then just imagine they're talking about what I want them to, and maybe use the speech bubble icons as inspiration/lead on what's happening.   
  
I hate how each new pack comes with more and more interactions, when when you watch the sims, its the same bloomin' animation anyway.

Number of items actually in packs,"I just bought lovestruck, even with annoying relationship stuff. The pack seemed empty, so I decided to count all the items in the expansion packs. I'm just missing for rent, hobbies and the fairy pack. I calculated the items so if there is 3 different height lights, that is one item or same mirror with different swatches, or same door in different height.  And for the older packs, combined some wall decals and posters as one item.

Also counted the debug items that are somewhat reasonable to use. Propably those has some same items than base game and other packs. But its hard to really know.

So the average in my calculations was 243 items, and lovestruck fourth worst as 223 (207 without wallpapers and floors).  

Seasons is the worst, with 160items, but it has the most gameplay items (15). Bu

Then University with 191, but it has second most build items (38), but only 6 gameplay items, but the robots are under debug.

Eco lifestyle is third worst 215, having just 98 items in regular catalog, but it has 55 in debug and 12 gameplay items. EA also lies that there is 46% more items, but we all know this, most the items in catalig duplicated, as so many is hidden behind gameplay.

The 4. is the lovestruck 223, only 6 gameplay items and 55 items hidden in live edit.

Then is cottage living with 223, that have only 115 in regural catalog and whopping 80 in live edit. Head of lovestruck with more gameplay items, and less wallpapers and floors.

Get famous getting 6. only with 11 wallpapers and 7 floors 233, it has one less item than cottage living. Plus items are in regular catalog, not in live edit.

7. is snowy escape 236, having 77 items in debug.

Then 8. Island living 243 items. This is only 15% lies.

9. is Growing together 244. Only 19% lies.

10. is Horse ranch with 251, with most 39 build items. 

Life and death is next with 251 with 94 of them hidden in debug. It's just top because I like it more. Horsies have one more gameplay item, less items hidden in live edit, but less items and few more floors. L&amp;D would be 4th if debug would not be counted,only 137 actual items.

12. is city living 266. It has only 12 build items, but that makes sense. 

High school years is next with 274, 69 if them being in debug.

14. Goes suprisingly get to work 277, also having only 14 live edit objects but 22 debugs.

The cats&amp;dogs with 304, and 57 live edits and second most debugs with 27. 36% lies.

And the most items is in Get together 311. Get to work has more in regular catalog, but here 60 live edit objects as well. This is also lying the most items, 125 (35%) are duplicates.

Tha average that EA is lying to us is 62 items or 27%. I checked the Eco Lifestyle and the debug furniture is not in the store listing, so it's only the duplicates.

Some of the calculations might be off, but I thought that least some of you might enjoy my findings.

I wish there was more interesting infant gameplay,"Initially I was excited about the inclusion of the infant life stage, but the more I play the more I realise how half-baked the life stage is. The only object they can really interact with for most of the life stage is the play mat. I would like to see more infant gameplay objects like bouncer chairs (could help them learn to sit up), walkers (could give a motor bonus trait when they age up to toddlers), play pens (could give an imagination bonus trait and work like the playhouse). 

It would also be more immersive to see some realistic risks for infants, as my own experience of babies is that they flirt with mortal peril on a daily basis. Like, so your infant has learned to pick things up? Congrats, they are now obsessed with picking up cat poop from the litter tray. Infant has learned to roll over? Well, now they keep rolling under the radiator and burning themself.

"They changed the Voice Acting for the Melodic voice, and I hate it","I don't know why more people are not talking about this, but after the last update, they've replaced many of the lines for the Melodic voice, and it is so egregious I can't help but think that every 30 seconds, a third of my female Sims turn into a completely different person.

It's scratchy and sounds completely off, like as if it was recorded in a different room or with a different mic. And even the Simlish is... different (which is fine, but it's noticeable, is my point). And frankly, the original Melodic Voice was exceptional, to me it was goofy, clumsy, and na√Øve, all at the same time... these new lines have none of that.

Look, I understand that the game is still in the making, and this is probably related to new lines we are going to get due to the upcoming pack. And I get that VO is a huge factor for EA, as Voice Actors are human beings, and 10 years is a long time. I honestly don't even know if these new lines were done by the same person. Or maybe she just had a cold or something. It happens, I get it.  
  
**Please don't get me wrong. No hate whatsoever for the Voice Actors. We love you.**  
  
But this is a terrible game design issue. Why on earth replace perfectly good lines that we've had for all these years, and on only one of the voices? (obviously because it wasn't really needed)

When they've added new lines for new options on Lovestruck, it's fine, even if it sounded a bit different or slightly off. But replacing big chunks of the main bulk of voice over lines, means that half the time the Sim is speaking, it is triggering the different set of voices.

I know maybe this sounds trivial, but I've grown used to these characters, and the Voice Acting is a huge part of their personality to me. Randomly making unnecessary changes to such an intrinsic aspect of their Simhood really bothers me. And not only that, it's bad for gameplay, as now I can't help but notice whenever the new voice comes up, which right now is quite often.

Please EA, revert it back!",0.96,770,0,770,1751800592.0

Enchanted by nature is the worst of 'Irish' representation.,"To start, this is all going to be under the assumption that the pack is attempting to be set in Ireland or some Ireland/Celtic inspired region. I am Irish myself so im making this mainly for non-Irish people who might think this is anything other than terrible.

Innisgreen as a town name had me excited at first, Innis being the Irish word for Island, basically naming the town after Ireland's nickname, The Emerald Isle. 

Yet the Townies have no signs of Irish names at all, or at best names so anglicized that they are unrecognisable! The Irish language has a wealth of quality names that it almost seems like the developers were aiming to mimic, yet they completely missed the mark. Flora, Mara and Todd could easily have been Fiona, Maire or Tadgh, instead they all have the most normal vaguely naturalistic english names.

And i must address that yes, this pack also focuses on fairies and their world, but Ireland itself has a great deal of folklore around fairies which is completely absent! Instead the pack focuses on the most generic barbie fairy aesthetic present in Supernatural in the Sims 3.I don't wish to rob those who have been waiting for this of that, but i just wanted if Ireland were to get a pack inspired in some way by it, for it to be mire authentic, akin to the effort put into Windenburg and Mount Komorebi.

This is a long rant i know and may be seen as taking this too seriously, but i fijd Ireland to be underrepresented in most media, and grossly stereotyped in what we do get appearances in, but the Sims has normally been better at this, I suppose my expectations were higher than the sims team could deliver.

The Bjergsen‚Äôs have the BEST storyline in my save.,"Out of all my households, the Bjergsens are easily the most interesting and fun to play in my save. I gave them everything: family tension, secret lives, messy emotions, and storylines that somehow built themselves while I was just trying to play normally. Genuinely the most fun storyline I did. 

Starting off with Clara, the mother. she‚Äôs a perfectionist to her core. She runs her household like it‚Äôs a project. every meal, every routine, every decision has to fit her vision of ‚Äúthe perfect family.‚Äù Her aspiration is successful lineage, which basically defines how she parents: she wants her kids to be perfect, ambitious, and successful in every measurable way. and because of that, she‚Äôs obsessed with the idea of raising a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù daughter. Naturally, she directs all of that energy toward Sofia, her oldest.

But Sofia was never meant to fit into Clara‚Äôs mold. In my save, I made her more of a repressed rebel. not the party-hard type, she just doesn‚Äôt care about the traditional path her mom wants for her. Clara keeps pushing her toward something stable, something ‚Äúrespectable,‚Äù but Sofia only cares about music. She loves songwriting, guitar, and singing. It‚Äôs what makes her feel alive. and school just doesn‚Äôt matter to her. She usually skips class and is a D student most of the time.

Eventually, Sofia starts dating Wolfgang, who‚Äôs part of the Renegades, which makes everything worse because Sofia herself is in the Paragons, their rival club. He‚Äôs rough around the edges, nothing like the kind of person Clara would ever approve of, and maybe that‚Äôs exactly why Sofia is drawn to him. Their friendship (and maybe more than that) gives her space to exist without being ‚Äúthe perfect daughter‚Äù.

The Paragons are all about looks, status, and image, the perfect club that Clara expects Sofia to be in, and Sofia can‚Äôt stand that. She falls out with their leader, and at that point, she‚Äôs pretty much done trying to fit in anywhere. Between the Paragons‚Äô impossible perfection and her mom‚Äôs constant pressure, she just wants to be free. She just wants to live as her own person. But her teenage years have already passed her by.

Meanwhile, Clara‚Äôs obsession with ‚Äúfixing‚Äù Sofia means her younger daughter, Elsa, often gets ignored &amp; overlooked. Elsa‚Äôs a genius, genuinely gifted in the noggin, but she doesn‚Äôt get much attention because her mom‚Äôs too focused on Sofia‚Äôs ‚Äúfailures.‚Äù But the irony is, Elsa ends up becoming everything Clara ever wanted.
Without anyone‚Äôs eyes on her, Elsa teaches herself, explores her curiosity, and grows into this brilliant mind. Clara doesn‚Äôt realize any of this yet, though, not until it‚Äôs too late. So Elsa ends up bonding more with her dad, Bjorn, and with another kid genius I made, Sophie Sue.

Sophie is one of my favorite Sims I‚Äôve ever made ‚Äî eccentric, erratic, 180 IQ, and endlessly curious. Elsa and Sophie Sue quickly become childhood best friends ‚Äî basically partners in crime. They instantly bond over their shared love for science and the weird, unexplained things in the world. And they also fill each other‚Äôs loneliness. From Elsa‚Äôs overlooked achievements, to Sophie‚Äôs orphaned, non sheltered life, they grow up side by side.

They form a club together where they do everything, build rockets, use microscopes and telescopes, program, play chess, you name it. What‚Äôs cute is that they‚Äôre not even competitive. They just love learning together, and that mutual curiosity keeps pushing them both forward, into a much brighter future. the perfect mix of calm intellect, reckless adventure, and the quiet comfort they find in each other.

Elsa becomes more of a robotics and programming genius, while Sophie Sue is the collector and environmental innovator ‚Äî she‚Äôs all about fossils, crystals, and nature. They balance each other out so well, and their bond just never fades. They move together, to Strangerville, work tirelessly together to uncover it‚Äôs mysteries, fight by and for each other and basically become the saviors of Strangerville.
The teenage prodigy duo.
Two heroes.

Back at home, Over time, Clara starts to realize something she can‚Äôt quite admit out loud: she spent years trying to mold Sofia into her idea of a perfect daughter, only to ignore the one who quietly became exactly that. Seeing her daughter‚Äôs face on the news ‚Äî the one she barely paid attention to ‚Äî smart, disciplined, accomplished..
She realizes, painfully, that the ‚Äúperfect daughter‚Äù she spent years trying to mold already existed right under her nose. However, Elsa became that all on her own, not because of Clara‚Äôs control, but in spite of it.

Elsa Bjergsen isn‚Äôt the quiet little sister anymore, she‚Äôs a famous, respected mastermind!

Clara feels the heavy weight of guilt, for pushing Sofia too hard and stifling her dreams, forcing her to start her dream life later than she should have. And for neglecting Elsa so deeply that she barely recognizes her own daughter anymore. She finally understands that her obsession with perfection didn‚Äôt just drive her family forward, it drove both her daughters away, in different ways.

Sofia‚Äôs relationship with Elsa is complicated too. a mix of gratitude and jealousy. She‚Äôs thankful that their mother‚Äôs attention finally shifted away from her, giving her room to breathe, but she can‚Äôt help envying her sister‚Äôs success. Elsa became this celebrated genius, the savior of Strangerville, while Sofia, who had her dreams pushed aside for so long, is still chasing her goal of becoming a famous musician. Elsa achieved everything Sofia once wanted: recognition, brilliance, freedom. It‚Äôs a bittersweet feeling, she‚Äôs proud of her sister, yet she can‚Äôt shake the ache of watching Elsa live the dream she spent her whole childhood trying to chase.

And on the flip side, Elsa carries her own quiet resentment toward Sofia as well, a small, unspoken belief that if Sofia had just gone along with their mother a little more, maybe Clara wouldn‚Äôt have ignored her so completely. It isn‚Äôt hate, not even anger, just that lingering what if that sits silently between them.

Then, on the other side of all this family drama, there‚Äôs Bjorn Bjergsen ‚Äî Clara‚Äôs husband and the quiet backbone of the household. He‚Äôs calm, steady, and seems like the least dramatic person in the family, but his story is easily the darkest.

Bjorn is a secret agent, high up in the Diamond Agent branch, level nine. He‚Äôs loyal, composed, and takes his work seriously, rarely talking about it at home. Naturally, Elsa gravitates toward him. She‚Äôs close to her father in a way her mother never was, she admires his calm logic, his quiet strength, and in some ways, she inherits it.

But Bjorn‚Äôs career has its shadows. Working for the S.I.M. Agency, he‚Äôs dealt with cases most people never hear about, fugitives, traitors, double agents. One of those names was Kayla Rossi, a former agent turned wanted criminal for treason. She defected years ago, leaking classified intel and vanishing from the system.

Here‚Äôs where the story gets dark, and where the game, completely by coincidence, handed me one of my favorite twists ever. 

Kayla Rossi, vanished years ago under mysterious circumstances. Everyone assumes she‚Äôs dead, and she is. What no one realizes, though, is that Bjorn was the one who unknowingly commissioned her assassination. It wasn‚Äôt personal, it was protocol. One he couldn‚Äôt disobey. She was wanted for treason, and eliminating her was part of his job. He never knew who she really was, never knew she was Sophie Sue‚Äôs mother until it was too late.

Sophie Sue‚Äôs Mother‚Ä¶
His daughter‚Äôs best friend ‚Äî the girl he welcomes into his home, the one who helped Elsa find herself ‚Äî lost her mother because of him.

They live together, work together, and are basically never apart. And meanwhile, the father of one unknowingly destroyed the mother of the other. Neither of them knows it, and now Bjorn has to live with the quiet tragedy sitting at the center of his own family.

That‚Äôs what makes the Bjergsens so special to me. Every single member carries their own story, It‚Äôs all connected. the mother who pushed too hard, the daughter who ran, the sister who rose, and the father whose duty turned into tragedy.

Just a little rant,"I hate that, ever since my child got the Mean Streak phase and was mean to her brother, that she's now randomly mean to him, even though she doesn't have the phase anymore, doesn't have any negative traits, and has a fantastic relationship with her brother.

Once her other brother got the phase, I noped out to a getaway for a few days. I wasn't gonna deal with another child being mean. I already have this issue with another Sim of mine in a different household. She keeps being mean to her family, even though she doesn't have mean traits, but she had gotten the Mean Streak phase as a child.

You ever not even play a family seriously and then end up loving them?,"One of my vampire ladies found a rando townie vampire as a date on Cupid‚Äôs Corner. He was meh looking, but not the worst as far as townies go, and what were the odds of finding a vampire in the wild when my save is inundated with werewolf townies due to past mistakes? She got pregnant, so I had them become official and moved them in together to see where things would go. After the first kid, they got pregnant at almost the same time, which I was really not happy about because I do not have much patience for multiple infants at the same time, but then the pseudo twins aged up, and I fell in love with them after already giving them stupid names when they were babies because I was mad at them, lol. 

The black-haired son is a vampire/werewolf hybrid‚ÄîI found out later that paternal grandpa is a hybrid werewolf/vampire/alien, which is what caused this weird case of vampires with a hybrid vampire/werewolf baby‚Äîside note: that guy is sooo glitched looking from being a hybrid, lol. But anyway, he was named Fern because his dad has the plant-lover trait, and the mom has the outdoorsy and mystical traits, so it felt stupid but right, and then the alien is named Moon because it was the first, half-arsed, space-related name I thought of at the time, and it also felt right for the hippy dippy mom. Their first kid was named Cosmo because mystical Sims have that ‚Äúconsult the cosmos‚Äù self interaction which I only noticed right before he was born. (I am awful at naming Sims.)

It was just funny timing, but the dad went into labor first with Moon at the same time a werewolf had made everyone faint from terror, so it seemed like he was scared into going into labor. But the boys were born just a few in-game hours apart and are BFF brothers from other mothers, literally, lol. With a hybrid occult mod and and a mod that makes turning Sims into vampires an action that can be done autonomously, Fern turned Moon into a vampire too, which I thought was fitting since they‚Äôre so close. They even got abducted at the exact same time once. 

The dad keeps getting abducted and had three more alien babies and got actual twins the last time, which topped off the household at 8, so then I had to take a break from that family to play the alien daughter separately and do Villainous Valentine, lol.

***Photos 4&amp;5:*** He left home early and comes home late. Bob didn't *plan* on running from their talk, but he couldn't help but fear the worst. He was *so sure* this talk was her telling him she was leaving, telling *him* to leave, that she's had enough. He can't bear the thought of life without her.

***Photos 6&amp;7:*** Eliza wakes Bob the next morning and tells him to prepare himself. She waits for him, surprisingly patiently, as he drags his feet, makes himself breakfast, brushes his teeth. She waits, and eventually... he comes to her. She doesn't want to *leave* him, but she can't keep living like this, either. They *need* this.

***Photo 8:*** She thought Cupid's Counselling would be... better. She didn't think everything would be magically back to normal after their first session, but she thought... she thought they'd at least be a *little* better. But the ride home is tense, Bob immediately goes down to the basement, and Eliza finds herself reaching for the bottle again...

***Photo 9:*** Eliza decides to take their counsellor's advice and opens up to Brent about the pregnancy, about what almost came to be. 

***Photos 10&amp;11:*** Another bender, and Eliza spends the night in the drunk tank. It's been a while since their first session, and Bob seems to be... doing better. He's taking his meds regularly, he's got a solo therapist to help with his depression, and Eliza is... stuck. She feels like she's slipping. She doesn't know how to stop...

***Photos 12&amp;13:*** Alice and Eric invite the Pancakes over to their house, but once again only Eliza goes. Bob's at work. Eliza dotes on Olivia and wonders what her child would have looked like. Then Alice gives her the news... she's expecting baby number two, and she wanted to tell Eliza in person, now, without anyone else around them, so that she doesn't feel like she has to hide how she really feels. Alice is her best friend, after all, but Eliza is happy for her. Really, she is.

***Photos 14&amp;15:*** But that doesn't stop her. She heads out to Oasis Springs, finds a bar out there. It's the afternoon, after all, too early for her to be drinking, and she can't risk it getting back to her friends, to Bob. But the bartender's nice. He listens to her, talks to her. She finds herself forgetting about everything in their conversations. He cuts her off, but it's too late. Eliza heads off into the night before he can offer to call her a cab home.

***Photos 16-19:*** Bob returned home from work with no sign of Eliza and a missed call from Alice. He calls, and she tells him what happened. About the baby, and Alice apologises that he has to find out over the phone, she wanted to tell them both together, but Eliza didn't look *right* when she left, and *is she home*? She wasn't. So Bob fell asleep on the sofa, and when Eliza came home, he told her to come sit with him. The thing is... Bob knew that the cleaning and the *anger* was Eliza's way of coping with their loss. He knew she couldn't let herself be sad. But he was struggling, too, and he didn't notice the drinking until it got to this point. Until she started staying out all night. He's worried about her. This is the most united they've been in... what feels like forever.

The best idea I‚Äôve ever had: The Lightning Riders,"Required DLC: Get together (for the club stuff)

Highly recommended DLC: City Living (for the Gremlins home trait) 

Club particulars‚Ä¶

Join requirements: not child, not ghost. 

Required activities: repair objects 

Banned activities: clean, be friendly 

Lot type: residential or tiny home

Lot traits: cursed, gremlins

Make counters, put dishwashers in them, put coffee makers on top. Have someone live in the area and go to sleep before midnight to activate the gremlins and break everything. Then start a club gathering. The dishwashers make puddles which will increase the risk of ‚Äúriding the lightning‚Äù significantly. Once all the things are fixed or all the sims have ridden the lightning, call off the group and sleep again to reactivate the Gremlins and break everything again. Then invite more people to the group. 

The graves will be in the household inventory so you can collect them for your own use.

My sim has the worst luck,"So my sim Anastasia, was in an arranged marriage to her husband Malakai. I‚Äôve made it a whole story like that theyre both from rich families, his family all died tragically in an accident when he was young and so he was raised by his grandmother out of the spotlight. 

Once Malakai became of age his grandmother told him that he needed to get out into society and get married, keep the bloodline going. His grandmother passed away from old age and shortly after her passing he decided that he‚Äôd marry Anastasia, after her parents put her into society. She was furious, she always wanted to marry someone out of love and not for money or power. So, she was mad at her parents and also mad at Malakai. They hated one another for a long time. 

Then Anastasia was frustrated because she couldn‚Äôt figure out how to cook anything, everything was bad quality and she just wanted to make something edible. That‚Äôs when Malakai stepped in and taught her how to cook his favourite meals. He was taught by his grandma and would cook everyday with her. He also taught her how to grow and harvest their own fruits and vegetables to be used. 

She taught him how to play the piano after she used to sit there for hours on end as a child being taught proper etiquette and skills for a lady. They soon fell in love. Seeing the hardships that one another faced growing up and loving each other for how they‚Äôd grown and become the person they are today. They had a daughter, Aurora. They loved her to pieces, Malakai being a very good father, doing tummy time with her and teaching her to crawl. Also helping her with her skills as a toddler and reading to her. 

Anastasia fell pregnant again, this time it was going to be a boy. The two of them couldn‚Äôt figure out a good name for their son, always putting names out there but none of them fitting. 

One night, with everyone asleep Malakai decided to go and look at the stars. Trying to get any inspiration for their son‚Äôs name. He thought this would be a good idea since their daughter was named after the lights in the sky, so why not have a look at them? Malakai was suddenly struck by a meteorite and tragically died that night. In the same night, Anastasia went into labour and delivered their baby boy. Malakai Jr.  

Anastasia was depressed after the tragic loss of her husband. She moved back in with her parents, where she raised her two children. 
After a few years she met a man that she fell in love with. She fell pregnant with his child. She proposed to him, hoping to complete her family. He said no. He ran away. Leaving her pregnant and alone. She panicked, and went to Marc a man who had been her friend for a few years now. 

Marc had a massive crush on her and tried to pursue her a few times now. Each time she said no, now, she ran to him. Telling him that she‚Äôs been interested all along, she just wasn‚Äôt ready to be with someone else after her husband. Marc was ecstatic. They soon got married, she gave birth to her daughter Amelia. Soon after that she fell pregnant again and gave birth to their daughter Abigail. 

They‚Äôd been struggling financially with four children to look after, having to sell items in the house just to be able to pay rent. Marc has been constantly burned out and now going through a midlife crisis. He must have been really struggling after finding out that one of his daughters isn‚Äôt actually his, because he just couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Laughing at himself for trusting Anastasia and raising that baby as his own. He laughed so much that he died. 

Now Anastasia is left all alone with four children, she could move back in with one of her parents. They divorced and her mum is raising her little sister, the baby she had to try to salvage her marriage. And her dad is married to an alien and has four alien babies with her. 
What am I supposed to do!?

Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if we could build outside our lot boundaries in The Sims 4? üè°‚ú®,"Hi everyone!

One thing I‚Äôve always wished for in The Sims 4 is the ability to build beyond the lot boundaries. Right now, our creativity is locked inside the lot, but imagine being able to expand into the surrounding streets, parks, and world areas to make neighborhoods feel truly alive.

This could:

Give builders so much more freedom.

Let us place houses, parks, or even small details outside the lot.

Make worlds feel more personal and customizable, keeping the game fresh.

I shared this idea on the official EA forum, and it would mean a lot if fellow players who like this vision could support it there. The more attention it gets, the better the chances EA/Maxis will notice!

A Sims 4 modder is charging early access for bug fixes. Is this where modding is headed?,"This might be one of the biggest shifts in Sims 4 modding I‚Äôve seen.

A popular creator ([JellyPaws](https://www.patreon.com/posts/137170630)) just announced they‚Äôre putting **critical fixes/compatibility updates** for their mods behind *Patreon early access*. The actual bug fixes that keep existing mods usable when a patch breaks them.

Yes, EA allows temporary paywalls (as long as it‚Äôs free later). But this feels different. Until that window passes, non-patrons can‚Äôt even use the mod they already had.

* If the creator doesn‚Äôt have time to update ‚Üí totally fair, life happens.
* If the fix *is done* but locked for paying users ‚Üí that‚Äôs a choice.

And that choice could set a precedent. If more modders follow, Sims modding could shift from passion-driven community work into something closer to paid maintenance.

üí¨ So I‚Äôm curious: **do you think bug fixes should ever be behind a paywall, even temporarily or is that a line we shouldn‚Äôt let modding cross?**",0.9,172,0,172,1755968253.0

Best Way to Torture Someone on the Beach?,"Tw: vague mentions of abuse

The bad news is that despite my successful initial play test before my first post, I have not been able to replicate buying the items from the buckets.

Free Love is Too Free...,"Once upon a time, there was a young adult named Airi Endo. She had a dream. A dream so big, it'd span generations: have 100 children. She knew it would be hard. No same sim wants to deal with multiple children in the worst stages of young life. But she was determined. However, no matter how seductive she made herself, these men were just too damn loyal. And then came Knox Greenwood. He told her all about eco living and about Neighborhood Action Plans. Knox offered a list of all the different plans a neighborhood could enact to make the world a better place. And within that list, she found her salvation. A NAP known as Free Love.

Free Love would let her be with anyone so long as she brought them home. And it wouldn't be considered cheating! It was almost too good to be true. So she asked Knox, who had just offered his services to her dream, how one would enact these NAPs. He said voting before Monday would be the best way and asking others to get on her side to sway the vote.

So Airi picked up a clipboard and regaled everyone she knew with the benefits of Free Love. Some Sims were against it, saying they could never be with someone other than their spouse. Others were totally onboard, eager to experience something (or someone) new. And with a little hard work and much persuasion, Free Love was enacted.

Her dream became easier than ever. One child turned to two. Two turned to three. And three turned to five! Soon she had all possible young life stages in her household and everything felt right in the world. But then she caught something in the halls of her humble home. Something that sent a chill down her spine.

Her two teens were flirting with each other. She reprimanded them both. But nothing could stop it once it started. And before she knew it, the benefits she once saw as favorable turned sour and crumbled before her. That's when Airi learned that Free Love is too free...

I quickly started disliking the height mod cos it glitched a lot and when the sims would cook or kiss, they would just go into each other and other objects and it didn‚Äôt feel natural. MC commands was actually fun and made the whole cheat system a lot easier, but it was a lot a little glitchy and I felt like it didn‚Äôt add too much to the gameplay.

"Base Game, Cats and Dogs ONLY Build!!","I wanted to make a house that was easily available for more simmers as I know not everyone has, wants, or can afford to have multiple packs or all of the packs. I don't normally like limiting what packs I use, but after doing this I think I kind of like limited pack builds and will do them more often.

While deciding where to build it, I decided that I wanted to give myself another challenge: I can't move or delete any of the default landscaping. I built on the Sporting Space lot in Brindleton Bay, right next to the vet office. I think there are two or three trees that come default, so I built the house around those trees and added some of my own landscaping. Side note: I hate landscaping, I haven't completely figured out how to make it look up to my personal standards yet.

This lot would be nice for a family of 3-4 sims, a cat, and a dog.

I thought I had called it the ""Cozy Colonial House""... but somehow I called it the ""Crazy Colonial House."" I'm not sure how because I've fully have been referring to it as the Cozy Colonial and just within the last couple of days did I realize my mistake.

I think I've narrowed down the crashing bug people keep on getting!,"So, after reinstalling my game, going through all 16k mod and cc files, and going insane, I believe I've narrowed down the reason for the crashing bug that so many people seem to be having.

**I believe that the crashing bug occurs when Sims make a family sized meal of anything (it might** ***only*** **be when the Sims use the stove).**

**Evidence:** I placed a sim on a lot by themselves, with all my mod and cc files removed, with just a fridge, counter, and stove and had them make a family sized meal (it seems to be okay with single servings). The moment the sim was half way through baking the meal the game crashed immediately.

I was able to back up my game files, reinstalled them and tried it again. The sim cooked the meal fully through this time, however, when I returned to the lot with the family meal plates on the counter the game would outright crash upon entering the lot.

I played the game for 3 hours today, breaking every stove in every lot they went into and didn't encounter a single crash.",0.9,54,0,54,1753341782.0

"Testing the rumored ""get leftovers"" bug","I've been seeing this topic come up once every few weeks or so. For the past few months, whenever the topic of Sims' body weight comes up, everyone in the comments starts discussing how selecting ""get leftovers"" supposedly tags the leftovers as junk food, causing the Sims to gain weight rapidly. The supposed solution to this is to open the refrigerator and select the leftovers manually. The first day I saw this theory show up was a Reddit post a few months ago from someone reporting they saw it on TikTok, but the comments in the post seemed to debunk the theory. It doesn't actually make any sense with how the calorie system works in the game, since ""junk food"" itself doesn't make Sims gain weight, at least not any faster than regular food does. Each specific dish is allotted a specific number of calories. The Reddit post was later taken down by the poster after the comments disagreed with the theory and explained how the calorie system works in the game.

Anyway, after seeing yet another post with the comments spreading this theory without any actual sources, I decided to test it myself. I wasn't actually planning to post it anywhere; it was more for my own sanity to make sure I wasn't going crazy lol. But since I took the time to test it, I figured I might as well post the results here. Like I said, it wasn't a super rigorous experiment, per say. But I had my two Sims spend a week eating nothing but garden salads and using only the ""get leftovers"" options, no opening the refrigerator. They weren't allowed to exercise or do anything but eat, sleep, read, clean, chat, and go to school/work. It was pretty boring. They did this for an entire week. At the end of the week, not only did they not gain any noticeable weight, but they both gained the health food nut lifestyles. During this week they didn't get any negative moodlets about eating quick meals or anything like that. I'll post before and after pictures in the comments below.

Disclaimer: I know that sometimes bugs happen, and not everyone has the same bugs. But people are claiming that the game is designed to consider ""leftovers"" as ""junk food,"" which clearly isn't the case. Furthermore, the ""tagging as junk food"" theory doesn't make sense to begin with since each meal has a set number of calories, with even some gourmet dishes being more fattening than certain junk food dishes. If there is a bug happening in regard to weight, it's not on the EA bug forums yet that I can find even though this theory has been around for months, and it certainly doesn't have anything to do with leftovers being tagged as junk food. Basically my point in making this post is to let you guys know that you don't have to be afraid of leftovers. If your Sims are gaining weight quickly, it's probably because of what you're feeding them.",0.99,750,0,750,1753324594.0

Or instead of ALLLLL the movie hangout interactions the interaction was just ""discuss movie with group"" and then you'd get a notification to say ""Sim 1 doesn't really like comedy, but Sim 2 loved it! And she fancied the pants off the main character""

And if ""Discuss interests"" could be where a lot of the pointless friendly and trait specific interactions could be converted to notification answers, or maybe even buffs. 

On this note, I truly don't understand people who get mods that basically just add more interactions that lead to nowhere. Like, if it copies an animation, which it will, it doesn't add gameplay for me. I'd rather just click ""argue"" / ""Discuss interests"" or whatever interaction gives the animation I want, and then just imagine they're talking about what I want them to, and maybe use the speech bubble icons as inspiration/lead on what's happening.

Number of items actually in packs,"I just bought lovestruck, even with annoying relationship stuff. The pack seemed empty, so I decided to count all the items in the expansion packs. I'm just missing for rent, hobbies and the fairy pack. I calculated the items so if there is 3 different height lights, that is one item or same mirror with different swatches, or same door in different height.  And for the older packs, combined some wall decals and posters as one item.

Also counted the debug items that are somewhat reasonable to use. Propably those has some same items than base game and other packs. But its hard to really know.

So the average in my calculations was 243 items, and lovestruck fourth worst as 223 (207 without wallpapers and floors).  

Seasons is the worst, with 160items, but it has the most gameplay items (15). Bu

Then University with 191, but it has second most build items (38), but only 6 gameplay items, but the robots are under debug.

Eco lifestyle is third worst 215, having just 98 items in regular catalog, but it has 55 in debug and 12 gameplay items. EA also lies that there is 46% more items, but we all know this, most the items in catalig duplicated, as so many is hidden behind gameplay.

The 4. is the lovestruck 223, only 6 gameplay items and 55 items hidden in live edit.

Then is cottage living with 223, that have only 115 in regural catalog and whopping 80 in live edit. Head of lovestruck with more gameplay items, and less wallpapers and floors.

Get famous getting 6. only with 11 wallpapers and 7 floors 233, it has one less item than cottage living. Plus items are in regular catalog, not in live edit.

7. is snowy escape 236, having 77 items in debug.

Then 8. Island living 243 items. This is only 15% lies.

9. is Growing together 244. Only 19% lies.

10. is Horse ranch with 251, with most 39 build items. 

Life and death is next with 251 with 94 of them hidden in debug. It's just top because I like it more. Horsies have one more gameplay item, less items hidden in live edit, but less items and few more floors. L&amp;D would be 4th if debug would not be counted,only 137 actual items.

12. is city living 266. It has only 12 build items, but that makes sense. 

High school years is next with 274, 69 if them being in debug.

14. Goes suprisingly get to work 277, also having only 14 live edit objects but 22 debugs.

The cats&amp;dogs with 304, and 57 live edits and second most debugs with 27. 36% lies.

And the most items is in Get together 311. Get to work has more in regular catalog, but here 60 live edit objects as well. This is also lying the most items, 125 (35%) are duplicates.

Tha average that EA is lying to us is 62 items or 27%. I checked the Eco Lifestyle and the debug furniture is not in the store listing, so it's only the duplicates.

Some of the calculations might be off, but I thought that least some of you might enjoy my findings.

Fairy: ‚ÄúHave a nice nap in the sun, bloodboy.‚Äù


üîÆSPELLCASTERS GET SHADE:

I shit you not, the fairies were just lurking in the canopy, silently judging spellcasters like:
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs not talk to them.‚Äù

Meanwhile, spellcasters:
‚ÄúI literally just conjured mac &amp; cheese and healed a child. What did I do??‚Äù

This is a one sided beef, btw! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs gagging me! There‚Äôs no bad reaction from spellcasters, just fairies showing up with decades of built-up judgment.

Vampires? Spellcasters fault.
Werewolves? Also Spellcaster fault.
But now the glitter mafia rolls in acting morally superior, like they weren‚Äôt sipping dew drops and refusing to engage during the worst magical crises in occult history???

THEY COULD HAVE HELPED!!!

THEY CAN CURE VAMPIRES!!! 

They could‚Äôve walked into the Vampire-Werewolf War and ended the whole thing in Act I, but instead, they looked down and said: 

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶ sounds like a spellcaster problem.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs giving Superman ignoring a bank robbery because he didn‚Äôt like the vibes.

And now, generations later, the fairies wanna roll in, like:

‚ÄúVampires are so toxic. Spellcasters are unnatural. Werewolves are a lot but like, cute.‚Äù

The audacity. Where were you when the Moonwood Collective begged for balance?

Spellcasters commune with ghosts, resurrect the dead, and brew  literal immortality in a bottle. Fairies see that and go,

‚ÄúYikes, babe. That‚Äôs not very sustainable.‚Äù

They act like forest Karens with winged privilege. This is NOT what I expected, but I am SO HERE FOR IT!!!",0.97,2698,0,2698,1751847122.0

I wish there was more interesting infant gameplay,"Initially I was excited about the inclusion of the infant life stage, but the more I play the more I realise how half-baked the life stage is. The only object they can really interact with for most of the life stage is the play mat. I would like to see more infant gameplay objects like bouncer chairs (could help them learn to sit up), walkers (could give a motor bonus trait when they age up to toddlers), play pens (could give an imagination bonus trait and work like the playhouse). 

It would also be more immersive to see some realistic risks for infants, as my own experience of babies is that they flirt with mortal peril on a daily basis. Like, so your infant has learned to pick things up? Congrats, they are now obsessed with picking up cat poop from the litter tray. Infant has learned to roll over? Well, now they keep rolling under the radiator and burning themself. 

What do you guys think?",0.84,64,0,64,1751833058.0
"They changed the Voice Acting for the Melodic voice, and I hate it","I don't know why more people are not talking about this, but after the last update, they've replaced many of the lines for the Melodic voice, and it is so egregious I can't help but think that every 30 seconds, a third of my female Sims turn into a completely different person.

It's scratchy and sounds completely off, like as if it was recorded in a different room or with a different mic. And even the Simlish is... different (which is fine, but it's noticeable, is my point). And frankly, the original Melodic Voice was exceptional, to me it was goofy, clumsy, and na√Øve, all at the same time... these new lines have none of that.

Look, I understand that the game is still in the making, and this is probably related to new lines we are going to get due to the upcoming pack. And I get that VO is a huge factor for EA, as Voice Actors are human beings, and 10 years is a long time. I honestly don't even know if these new lines were done by the same person. Or maybe she just had a cold or something. It happens, I get it.  
  
**Please don't get me wrong. No hate whatsoever for the Voice Actors. We love you.**  
  
But this is a terrible game design issue. Why on earth replace perfectly good lines that we've had for all these years, and on only one of the voices? (obviously because it wasn't really needed)

When they've added new lines for new options on Lovestruck, it's fine, even if it sounded a bit different or slightly off. But replacing big chunks of the main bulk of voice over lines, means that half the time the Sim is speaking, it is triggering the different set of voices.

I know maybe this sounds trivial, but I've grown used to these characters, and the Voice Acting is a huge part of their personality to me. Randomly making unnecessary changes to such an intrinsic aspect of their Simhood really bothers me. And not only that, it's bad for gameplay, as now I can't help but notice whenever the new voice comes up, which right now is quite often.

Please EA, revert it back!",0.96,766,0,766,1751800592.0
Glass walls are the best thing that has happened to the game recently,"I've been having so much fun with these glass wallpapers, I didn't even know I needed them so badly in the game!

Things I wish we got more in the sims 4 that nobody talks about,"1:We really need more Televisions! 

  
I feel like I end up using the same 2 base game television because the ammount of television and the variety of actually usable tv's are quite low.

  
It's can't be THAT hard to introduce more televisions in a pack/ base game updates

  
2: Not an addition but a remodel of the phone. The Base game phone and it's screen seems super outdated now, I can't explain it but It just feels outdated.

Thoughts on Enchanted by Nature?,"Now that the embargo has lifted, I‚Äôm curious to know what everyone thinks of Enchanted by Nature. 

In my opinion, it looks like an expansion pack for fairies. I feel like they wanted to add fairies, but couldn‚Äôt do a game pack so they scrounged up whatever other ideas they could to make an expansion pack. Ailments are glorified illnesses from Get to Work, the luck system is depthless, living off the land is just recycled werewolf abilities, houseplants are whatever, and there was no need for elixirs when we have potions, serums, and herbal remedies. Fairies, CAS, and build/buy are literally the only redeeming qualities of this pack. I hate to sound negative, but these subpar expansion packs are really getting old. If we aren‚Äôt getting anymore game packs, the least y‚Äôall can do is make the expansion packs more worthwhile. ",0.89,474,0,474,1751631259.0

Enchanted by nature is the worst of 'Irish' representation.,"To start, this is all going to be under the assumption that the pack is attempting to be set in Ireland or some Ireland/Celtic inspired region. I am Irish myself so im making this mainly for non-Irish people who might think this is anything other than terrible.

Innisgreen as a town name had me excited at first, Innis being the Irish word for Island, basically naming the town after Ireland's nickname, The Emerald Isle. 

Yet the Townies have no signs of Irish names at all, or at best names so anglicized that they are unrecognisable! The Irish language has a wealth of quality names that it almost seems like the developers were aiming to mimic, yet they completely missed the mark. Flora, Mara and Todd could easily have been Fiona, Maire or Tadgh, instead they all have the most normal vaguely naturalistic english names.

And i must address that yes, this pack also focuses on fairies and their world, but Ireland itself has a great deal of folklore around fairies which is completely absent! Instead the pack focuses on the most generic barbie fairy aesthetic present in Supernatural in the Sims 3.I don't wish to rob those who have been waiting for this of that, but i just wanted if Ireland were to get a pack inspired in some way by it, for it to be mire authentic, akin to the effort put into Windenburg and Mount Komorebi.

This is a long rant i know and may be seen as taking this too seriously, but i fijd Ireland to be underrepresented in most media, and grossly stereotyped in what we do get appearances in, but the Sims has normally been better at this, I suppose my expectations were higher than the sims team could deliver.

When your girlfriend meets your Doppelganger.,"So, I made a fresh sim for the event. His name is James Kyleson (no relation). He is Gregarious, Lazy, Cheerful and lately Romantic. He is a gardener at 19 Culpepper with a few added struggles (more maintenance due to the For Rent lot challenge, and a hot water heater and electrical box added to the TLC). When he started out things where nice and slow, till he met Penny, who immediately confessed to having a hard time and was looking for a place to stay. He said yes as he is a stand up dude. She immediately seduced him, and now I have to sheppard 2 characters with plummeting needs in the worst apartment. Penny got a work from home task to go to the H&amp;H fest and be mischievous to 5 people. Being a supportive boyfriend, James tags along. Right when they get there, buying fireworks, they happen across this dude. Where does this story go?",1.0,9,0,9,1751553538.0
